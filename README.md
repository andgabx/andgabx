### Hi! 😁

Nice to meet you! I'm Anderson Gabriel, born and raised in Brazil and pursuing my Software Engineering degree, on my way to be a Front-End Developer!

I'm currently looking for an internship as I just started my graduation and want to have as much experience as possible until I graduate from my college 👨‍🎓

Javascript is the main subject I've been studying these last months ❤️
